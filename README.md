# PWYW
PWYW or Pay What You Want is a series of projects that I will be working on in order to gain general experience. Clients may pay whatever they like for whatever the project is, as either way I take something from it (i.e experience). 

##This Project
Merge two existing open-source websites into one, and modifying it for use as a cryptocurrency faucet. The two websites are ["Transitions-for-off-canvas-navigations"](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/08/28/transitions-for-off-canvas-navigations/) and ["FullscreenForm"](http://tympanus.net/Development/FullscreenForm/). Additionally convert this code so it is compatible with faucet box, where it can easily be used as a template, and add support for advertising.

##Preview (For now no longer functional due to html to php conversion)
~~See a live preview of the site in it's current development state [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BurnBabyBurn71/PWYW_Faucet/blob/master/index.html)~~

##Usage
 - Create a folder in the templates folder of Faucet in a Box (the name of the folder will be the title of the template)
 - Move contents of this repository to the folder you have create
 - Apply the template to the site in the admin page
