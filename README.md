# PWYW
PWYW or Pay What You Want is a series of projects that I will be working on in order to gain general experience. Clients may pay whatever they like for whatever the project is, as either way I take something from it (i.e experience). 

##This Project
A simple one, essentially merge two existing open-source websites into one, and modifying it for use as a cryptocurrency faucet. The two websites are ["Transitions-for-off-canvas-navigations"](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/08/28/transitions-for-off-canvas-navigations/) and ["FullscreenForm"](http://tympanus.net/Development/FullscreenForm/).
